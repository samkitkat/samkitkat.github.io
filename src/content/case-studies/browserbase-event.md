# Project Overview

For Browserbase’s Series B launch <a href="https://x.com/samkitkat_/status/1935402776458326282?s=20" class="about-link">event</a>, I worked as part of the team organizing a 150+ person gathering for founders, builders, and friends of the company. Alongside logistics and coordination, I created visual assets used throughout the event.

My goal was to support an atmosphere that felt intentional, celebratory, and aligned with Browserbase’s brand — from the way people entered the space to the smaller details they noticed while they were there.

## Selected Design Assets

Below are a few of the pieces I personally designed for the event.
