# Project Overview

The goal of this redesign was to transform the Lebanese American Women Association (LAWA) website into a clear, trustworthy, and informative resource. The previous site lacked essential information about the organization, making it difficult for visitors to understand LAWA’s mission or engage with its programs.  

In one month — through five structured meetings — I led a full redesign focused on readability, visual clarity, and strategic storytelling.

**Problem:**  
The site’s content structure didn’t communicate who LAWA was, what they did, or why their work mattered. Users lacked context and confidence.

# Research Phase

Before designing, I explored websites from other nonprofit and community-focused organizations to understand what builds trust and supports user needs.

### Key insights

- Essential information should appear **on the homepage**, not hidden in subpages.  
- Subpages should provide **clear, detailed explanations** of programs and impact.  
- Many successful nonprofits use **timelines** or milestone overviews to show progress.  
- Donation pages often feature **calls to action**, employer match details, and clear value statements.

This research shaped the foundation of the content hierarchy and visual direction.

# Ideation Phase

After determining what users needed (and what the organization wanted to highlight), I shifted to designing the content structure.

Because this project was built in **WordPress**, I streamlined the design process by selecting and evaluating templates rather than creating multiple wireframes.

### Homepage goals

- Highlight core services and offerings  
- Introduce the team and organization identity  
- Include testimonials from partners and collaborators  

### Additional improvements

- Build an **Impact page** with a clear narrative  
- Create an **Education page** describing programs and resources  
- Redesign the **Donation page** for clarity and engagement

# UI Design Phase

For typography, I chose **Roboto** for its legibility and accessibility.  
Visually, I incorporated deep greens inspired by the cedar tree on the Lebanese flag, rooting the brand in cultural identity.

I also used imagery from Lebanese landmarks to create a sense of familiarity and connection — especially for diaspora communities.

The final interface balances warmth, clarity, and trust-building cues.

# Conclusion

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Working directly with nonprofit leadership  
- Implementing and customizing WordPress themes  
- Making design decisions under platform constraints  
- Structuring content for clarity and storytelling  
- Managing feedback cycles in fast-paced redesigns  

The free version of WordPress presented limitations, but by customizing theme code, I was able to deliver the functionality LAWA needed.

# Key Takeaways

- **Pre-planning matters.** Outlining content sections early dramatically speeds up development.  
- **Moodboards and early visual direction** help avoid costly revisions later.  
- **Templates aren't shortcuts** — they require thoughtful evaluation and customization.
