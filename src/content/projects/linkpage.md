As an individual with multiple online profiles across various social media platforms, I always found it challenging to manage and share them effectively. I wanted to showcase my online presence in one place, and that's when I stumbled upon Linktree.

Linktree is a popular tool used by influencers, artists, and businesses to share links to their various online profiles in a single location. It's a fantastic way to provide a convenient experience for followers who are looking for more information about you, your work, or your brand.

However, as a web developer, I always enjoy building things myself, so I decided to create my own Linktree clone. I knew it would be a fun project that would allow me to showcase my skills and create something that would be useful for myself.

### The Process

### V1

I first started by following [Takuya Matsuyama's](https://www.craftz.dog/) ["link in bio page"](https://youtu.be/u71pHOyvBp0) tutorial. See his source code on [github](https://github.com/craftzdog/link-in-bio)!

Here is how V1 of my link page turned out ‚á©
